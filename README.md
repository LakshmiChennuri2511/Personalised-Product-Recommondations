#Problem Statement: Personalized Product Recommendations for Enhanced Retailer Experience
  The primary problem is that retailers struggle to deliver a consistently personalized and engaging shopping experience across all channels, leading to missed opportunities for customer satisfaction, loyalty, and sales.
  The solution is to move beyond standard rule-based or collaborative filtering systems to a hybrid approach that incorporates generative AI for hyper-personalized, conversational recommendations. This system addresses the limitations of traditional models while providing real-time, context-aware suggestions across multiple channels.
